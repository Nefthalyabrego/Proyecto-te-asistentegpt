You'll find a number of vulnerability types and severity levels, as well as CVSS scores, vendor projects, product names, and other pertinent information. By arming yourself with this knowledge, you can better protect your network from any potential security issues that may arise - now or in the future. Dive into details such as attack vectors, complexity ratings and required actions for each vulnerability to stay prepared and protected throughout your journey! Every single detail matters when it comes to keeping yourself secure online - so explore some of these potential risks and gain valuable insights today!\n\n### More Datasets\n&gt; For more datasets, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator/datasets).\n\n### Featured Notebooks\n&gt; - ðŸš¨ **Your notebook can be here!** ðŸš¨! \n\n### How to use the dataset\n&gt; This dataset provides a comprehensive list of security vulnerabilities in the United States from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog for the year 2022, including vulnerability types, severity levels, CVSS scores, vendor projects, product names, and other relevant information.
