	abstract = {Most areas of Python data science have standardized on using Pandas DataFrames for representing and manipulating structured data in memory. Natural Language Processing (NLP), not so much. We believe that Pandas has the potential to serve as a universal data structure for NLP data. DataFrames could make every phase of NLP easier, from creating new models, to evaluating their effectiveness, to building applications that integrate those models. However, Pandas currently lacks important data types and operations for representing and manipulating crucial types of data in many of these NLP tasks. This paper describes Text Extensions for Pandas, a library of extensions to Pandas that make it possible to build end-to-end NLP applications while representing all of the applications' internal data with DataFrames. We leverage the extension points built into Pandas library to add new data types, and we provide important NLP-specfific operations over these data types and and integrations with popular NLP libraries and data formats.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have led to the gathering of an enormous scale of data. The exploration of such huge quantities of data needs more efficient methods with high analysis accuracy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning and evolutionary algorithms able to provide more precise, faster, and scalable outcomes in big data analytics. Despite this interest, as far as we are aware there is not any complete survey of various artificial intelligence techniques for big data analytics. The present survey aims to study the research done on big data analytics using artificial intelligence techniques. The authors select related research papers using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. Four groups are considered to investigate these mechanisms which are machine learning, knowledge-based and reasoning methods, decision-making algorithms, and search methods and optimization theory. A number of articles are investigated within each category. Furthermore, this survey denotes the strengths and weaknesses of the selected AI-driven big data analytics techniques and discusses the related parameters, comparing them in terms of scalability, efficiency, precision, and privacy. Furthermore, a number of important areas are provided to enhance the big data analytics mechanisms in the future.},

	abstract = {At present, most of the economic, commercial, cultural, social and governmental activities and interactions of countries, at all levels, including individuals, non-governmental organizations and government and governmental institutions, are carried out in cyberspace. Recently, many private companies and government organizations around the world are facing the problem of cyber-attacks and the danger of wireless communication technologies. Today's world is highly dependent on electronic technology, and protecting this data from cyber-attacks is a challenging issue. The purpose of cyber-attacks is to harm companies financially. In some other cases, cyber-attacks can have military or political purposes. Some of these damages are: PC viruses, knowledge breaks, data distribution service (DDS) and other assault vectors. To this end, various organizations use various solutions to prevent damage caused by cyber-attacks. Cyber security follows real-time information on the latest IT data. So far, various methods had been proposed by researchers around the world to prevent cyber-attacks or reduce the damage caused by them. Some of the methods are in the operational phase and others are in the study phase. The aim of this study is to survey and comprehensively review the standard advances presented in the field of cyber security and to investigate the challenges, weaknesses and strengths of the proposed methods. Different types of new descendant attacks are considered in details. Standard security frameworks are discussed with the history and early-generation cyber-security methods. In addition, emerging trends and recent developments of cyber security and security threats and challenges are presented. It is expected that the comprehensive review study presented for IT and cyber security researchers will be useful.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to substantiate the logical interconnection of social consequences of the digital economy and its consequences for cyber security and to develop – based on this interconnection - the scientific and methodological provision of systemic monitoring of the digital economy and the model of managing the digital economy for maximizing public well-being and overcoming the cyber threats. Design/Methodology/Approach: For determining the interdependence (cross-correlation) between human development index (indicator of public well-being) and cyber security index (indicator of cyber threats), the authors use the method of correlation analysis; for determining their dependence on the index of digital competitiveness (indicator of the digital economy) the authors use the method of regression analysis. As a result, the authors determine low information content of the statistical indicators that reflect the integral characteristics of public well-being and cyber security and come to the conclusion on inapplicability of the standard (e.g., econometric) methods in the work. That’s why the method of logical analysis is used for analyzing the qualitative essence of social consequences of cyber threats of the digital economy. Findings: It is proved that social consequences of the digital economy and its consequences for the cyber security are interconnected and could and should be studied and managed as a whole. It is substantiates that when treating the cyber threats it is necessary to focus not on their technical components (causes of threats that are determined by the specifics of digital technologies) but on social components – i.e., objects of threats – various categories of the population. In this case, the influence on public well-being becomes a common basis of the studied consequences. Originality/Value: Based on the determined interconnection, the authors develop the scientific and methodological provision of systemic monitoring of effectiveness of the digital economy, which envisages comparison of its social advantages and allows determining the top-priority objects of the digital economy management. Approbation of the offered methodological provision by the example of the digital economy of Russia in 2018 showed its low effectiveness. In order to increase it, it is recommended to use the developed model of managing the digital economy for maximizing public well-being and overcoming the cyber threats.},

Using Google's advanced search, a corpus of 140 pieces of information was extracted and analyzed using the criteria of newsworthiness and information sources. The results show an episodic and shallow coverage of a complex phenomenon that generated a wide social discontent in a society with high levels of inequality. Recommendations are offered that could contribute to a dissemination aimed at the understanding of this phenomenon as a by-product of social inequality, but also as a deepener of it.},

	abstract = {Consumer research on conversational agents (CAs) has been growing. To illustrate and map out research in this field, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of published work indexed in the Clarivate Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases. Four dominant topical areas were identified through bibliographic coupling. They are 1) consumers’ trust in CAs; 2) Natural Language Processing (NLP) in developing and designing CAs; 3) communication with CAs; 4) impact of CAs on value creation and the value of CAs for business. We leverage these findings to provide an updated synopsis of extant scientific work. Moreover, we draw a framework whereby we identify the: 1) drivers of and motivators for adoption and engagement with CAs; and 2) the outcomes of CA adoption for both users and organizations. Finally, we leverage the framework to develop an agenda for future research.},

	abstract = {This article argues that to make sense of surveillance today, the concept of surveillance culture should be added to the conceptual tool kit. This goes beyond the important concerns of the  surveillance state  and  surveillance society  to examine how today’s subjects make sense of, respond to, and—in some cases—initiate surveillance activities. Building conceptually on Charles Taylor’s work, the concepts of surveillance imaginaries and surveillance practices are proposed as a means of analysis of how surveillance is engaged today. Previous studies have hinted at surveillance culture both explicitly and implicitly, but more is needed. This article explores further one illustrative dimension—that of online practices of  sharing . These practices are seen, in turn, in relation to  visibility  and  exposure . Finally, the concept of surveillance culture is shown to be relevant to current discussions ethics and of digital citizenship.},

	abstract = {Internet users face some problems and are particularly vulnerable to unwanted third parties due to depend on the internet for their use. Especially, the students who are studying in higher institutions are surfing the internet for many purposes without considering safe browsing. Evidence of literature and the results of the pilot study motivated the researchers to assess the levels of internet browsing security awareness among undergraduates of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka and to suggest security measures to overcome internet vulnerabilities. Data were collected from 300 undergraduates within six faculties using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was aimed on awareness of students in terms of three variables including knowledge of malware, use of strong password, and knowledge of third-party security towards the awareness of internet browsing security. The collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics including frequencies, measure of central tendency and measure of dispersion used to measure the way of responses. The hypotheses were tested using correlation analysis and regression analysis. All the hypotheses were accepted while supporting 52 percent explanatory power of independent variables on awareness of internet browsing security. Then the researchers could identify and verify the level of awareness regarding the secured browsing behaviour of the undergraduates that are not at satisfactory level. Further, based on the findings, the researchers recommended that the university should organize programs to increase the level of knowledge of undergraduates about safe internet browsing. First, it should be started by the faculty level and should track the progress of undergraduate safe browsing behaviour while expanding the study over to other government Universities in Sri Lanka.

	abstract = {Despite  the  fact  that  the  Internet  has  positively impacted  people’s  lives,  there  are  negative  issues  emerged related  to  the  use  of  Internet.  Cases  like  cyber-bully,  online fraud,  racial  abuse,  pornography  and  gambling  had  increased tremendously due to the lack of awareness and self-mechanism among Internet users to protect themselves from being victims to these acts. However, past research revealed that the level of awareness among Internet users is still low or moderate. One of the  vital  measures  to  be  taken  is  to  cultivate  knowledge  and awareness  among  Internet  users  from  their  early  age,  i.e., young   children.   Young   children   specifically,   need   to   be educated  to  operate  in  a  safe  manner  in  cyberspace  and  to protect   themselves   in   the   process.   The   objective   of   this systematic  review  paper  is  to  explore  why  it  is  so  critical  that modern  learners  are  educated  about  the  risks  associated  with being active in cyberspace and the strategies that stakeholders can use to promote cyber security education in schools. In this paper,  few  strategies  are  discussed  as  how  cyber  security education can be implemented in schools. },

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and
	benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
	a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
	still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
	thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
	task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
	current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
	language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
	even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
	approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
	175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
	and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
	applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
	demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
	achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
	question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
	on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
	novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
	we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
	as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
	training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
	of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
	articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding
	and of GPT-3 in general.},
